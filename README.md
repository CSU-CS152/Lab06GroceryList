# Attached is some code
Review the code provided. Answer the following questions by adding comments to your code! You are free to talk with other students, and seek better understanding to these questions. See below for reminders on types, variables, and input

# Step 1
What is the output for multiply(3, 4), and what type is it?
What happens if I do multiply(add(7, 2), 2)? What is the output and what type is it?
What is the difference between add(“3”, “4”) and add(3, 4). What do the outputs look like and why?
What is main doing? What is printed if the console input is 2 9
Set a variable to “dog”. What type is this?
Set another variable to 7 as a float using casting.

# Step Two: Coding: \[]
Find the function \[]. 

# Step 3: Test \[]
How do you test code? You simply add the lines to your python file (in the future, you will have test lines in separate files).

As such, we would recommend adding the following just above def main().

print("TESTING", \[]) 

print("TESTING", \[]) 

Also add your own tests!
